User interface of the calculator

Used Java.swing to create the user interface

The numbers and operations are classed as buttons to receive user Input

# 8 Tasks

# 1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers

    This is operated by the user interface

# 7. Conversion of a decimal number to hexadecimal

    Step 1: First, divide 960 by 16.
    960 ÷ 16 = 60 and remainder = 0

    Step 2: Again, divide quotient 60 by 16.
    60 ÷ 16 = 3 and remainder 12.

    Step 3: Again dividing 3 by 16, will leave quotient=0 and remainder = 3.

    Step 4: Now taking the remainder in reverse order and substituting the equivalent hexadecimal value for them, we get 3→3, 12→C and 0→0
    Therefore, (960)10 = (3C0)16

# 8. Conversion of a hexadecimal number to decimal

    Step 1: Write the decimal equivalent of each digit of the number in hexadecimal form (from the above table)
    Step 2: Multiply the digits from right to left with exponents of 160, 161, 162, ... in order starting from the right most digit.
    Step 3: Then add all the products. The resultant sum is the number in the decimal system.
